Big O 


Big O is the metric used to guage the efficiancy of the code



Run time complexities



Constant time complexity O(1)
It is when the time required to run the operation is constant.


N time complexities O(n) linear time complexity
as the numner of input grows the time complexity also grows proportionately.
